<h1>The Backup of Dynamic DNS palmmicro.ddns.us</h1>
<p>March 7, 2016
<br /><a href="20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> internal server used the free Dynamic DNS palmmicro.ddns.us provided by <a href="http://www.changeip.com/" target=_blank>ChangeIP.com</a> for over 10 years.
Recently it is working very strange, the IP resolved would always be the wrong IP from previous connection, I do not know if it is a way to push us to use its paid service began in recently years or not.
Any way, it is preventing our test <a href="../../../contactus/pbx.html">IP-PBX</a> and developing Source Safe from working smoothly.
<br />To continue seeking the free service from internet, I studied the DDNS service provider in China. Most of their service are paid too, but every account can still have one free DDNS record.
<br />The most famous <a href="http://www.oray.com/" target=_blank>oray.com</a> is tricky, after registraion it generated my free DDNS 1bj4595225.iok.la automatically, and I can never change it again.
<br /><a href="http://pubyun.com/" target=_blank>PubYun</a> is better, allowed me to add the palmmicro prefix: palmmicro.f3322.net.
<br />We are using this 2 Chinese free DDNS for backup for the moment.
