<h1>Palmmicro MAC Address</h1>
<p>Nov 14, 2009
<br />PA1688 related enquiry is gradually faded out over the years. The question style is also changing. Instead of <font color=gray>I opened the box and saw a <a href="../ar1688/20061014.php">PA1688PQ</a> chip there</font>,
now most of the questions start with <font color=gray>I have a device with MAC address 00-09-45-xx-xx-xx which is registered by your company</font>.
<br />I always answer <font color=gray>please send pictures of your device, with views from both outside and inside</font>. Actually none of those device with Palmmicro <a href="../ar1688/20070827.php">MAC</a> is related with any Palmmicro products. 
I guess some old <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> manufacturers are still using 00-09-45 MAC on their TI and Infineon chip based VoIP products.
<br />Also I have to say that 00-09-45 MAC is not related with us any more since about 4 years ago. Instead, we applied 00-18-1f-xx-xx-xx MAC address from IEEE for new <a href="20080326cn.php">Palmmicro</a> products.
This is why the default MAC in <a href="../pa6488/20090927.php">safe mode</a> for PA1688 devices is 00-09-45-00-00-00, and the default MAC in safe mode for <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> and <a href="../../../pa6488/index.html">PA6488</a> devices is 00-18-1f-00-00-00.
