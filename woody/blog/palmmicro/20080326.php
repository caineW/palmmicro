<h1>The History of Palmmicro.com Domain</h1>
<p>March 26, 2008
<br />In early 1999, <a href="20061123.php">Dr Wang</a> founded Palmmicro in Santa Clara and began to use Palmmicro.com.
<br />In late 2002, Palmmicro changed its name to Centrality, the domain registration expired in 2003.
<br />A domain trading company owned it from Dec 25, 2003 to Dec 25, 2007. During this period, Centrality discontinued its <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> VoIP business and later acquired by <a href="../entertainment/20070813.php">SiRF</a>.
We founded Palmmicro again in China, continue our small VoIP business with the new <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> chip.
<br />On Feb 5, 2008, the expired domain name came into <i>Redemption Period</i>.
<br />On March 6, the domain name became <i>Pending Delete</i>.
<br />On March 13, the domain was strangely registered by an Oregon domain trading company. I was so disappointed at that time.
<br />On today, March 26, I tried <?php EchoLink('https://who.is'); ?> search again, and found the domain name available. I registered it under my name at once.
